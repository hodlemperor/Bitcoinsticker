# Bitcoin sticker

I downloaded some logos of bitcoin related services, I try to vectorize most of all and add a cut profile to eack logo. In particoular I create the CutCountour which is necessary for cutting on the roland plotter.

I uploaded here if anyone else needs it. The stickers are good for advertising bitcoin and this file is for private use. 
It is also possible to buy somewhere .. just google it.
