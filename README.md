# Bitcoin sticker

I downloaded some logos of bitcoin related services, I try to vectorize most of all and add a cut trace to each logo. In particular I use CutCountour as trace, which is necessary for cutting on the roland plotter.

The stickers are a good way for advertising bitcoin but this file is for private use. 
It is also possible to buy somewhere .. just google it.
